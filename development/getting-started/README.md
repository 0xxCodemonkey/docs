# Getting Started

This section has been created to allow anyone who isn't familiar with development on Secret Network to get a taste of the tools used during contract development. The goal is to provide an easy guide to follow, with step-by-step instructions. We will also be going over some of the unique characteristics of contracts on Secret Network, though we will keep things at a very high level.

We will be covering:

* Setting up a development Environment
* Compiling and Deploying a Secret Contract
* Interacting with Contracts on the Secret Network
* (optional) Basic breakdown of a Secret Contract

What we **won't** be covering:

* In-depth guide to developing Secret Contracts
* Secret Network architecture
* How to create a web UI for your Secret Contract

Though this guide is Secret Network specific, most of what is being covered can be applied to other Cosmos-based blockchains as well.
