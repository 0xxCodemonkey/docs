# Permissioned Viewing

Permissioned viewing is entirely unique to Secret Network with its encrypted state. It gives you ability to have precise control over who has access to what data. In order to determine when data is allowed to be released however, you need to have a way to prove who is trying to access it. Our two ways of doing this are through Viewing Keys and Permits/Certs.
