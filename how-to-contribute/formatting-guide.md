# Style Guide

## Introduction&#x20;

The Secret Network style guide aims to provide guidance related to the writing and formatting of contributions to the network's documentation by any stakeholder. The style guide serves to contribute to the creation of consistent technical communication across all Secret Network documentation.&#x20;

### Objectives

There are three primary objectives of the Style Guide:&#x20;

1. To provide a guide for the creation of consistent written communications across the Secret Network ecosystem
2. A review of the Style Guide at least once a year to ensure it reflects modern practices and is suitable for its purpose, and to be updated on an as-needed basis.&#x20;
3. The style guide review process will accept proposals from the community who disagree with existing guidelines, and Secret Labs will act as an arbiter in those cases.&#x20;

### What the style guide does not include

The guide does not describe exactly how to write. It aims to help community members write correctly, and encourage consistency across all parts of the Secret Network documentation.&#x20;
