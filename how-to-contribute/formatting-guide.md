# Style Guide

## Introduction&#x20;

The Secret Network style guide aims to provide guidance related to the writing and formatting of contributions to the network's documentation by any stakeholder. The style guide serves to contribute to the creation of consistent technical communication across all Secret Network documentation.&#x20;

### Objectives

There are three primary objectives of the Style Guide:&#x20;

1. To provide a guide for the creation of consistent written communications across the Secret Network ecosystem
2. A review of the Style Guide at least once a year to ensure it reflects modern practices and is suitable for its purpose, and to be updated on an as-needed basis.&#x20;
3. The style guide review process will accept proposals from the community who disagree with existing guidelines, and Secret Labs will act as an arbiter in those cases.&#x20;

### What the style guide does not include

The guide does not describe exactly how to write. It aims to help community members write correctly, and encourage consistency across all parts of the Secret Network documentation.&#x20;

## Abbreviations, contractions, and acronyms

### General rule

Full stops and spaces between letters should not be used after all abbreviations, contractions, and acronyms.&#x20;

### Abbreviations

Abbreviations are made when letters are intentionally omitted from the end of words.&#x20;

* Decentralized applications --> Dapps
* Ethereum --> Eth
* Address --> Addy
* Multi-signature --> Multi-sig
* Market capitalization --> Mcap
* Lamborghini --> Lambo

### Contractions

Contractions are made when letters are intentionally omitted from the middle of words.&#x20;

* Transaction -> Tx
* Unspent transaction --> Utxo
* Wrecked --> Rekt
* [Satoshis](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp) --> Sats

### Acronyms

Acronyms are made from the initial letter of a sequence of words and should be written with a single string of upper-case letters.&#x20;

* Software Guard Extensions --> SGX
* Central Processing Units --> CPUs
* Software Development Kit --> SDK
* Trusted Execution Environment --> TEE

## Capitalization&#x20;

In general, capital letters should **not** be used unless absolutely required.&#x20;

### Specific words

### Titles

## Numbers

Whole numbers should be written/spelled out between one to ten, and figures should be used for numbers above 10. For example, the number five should be spelled out and the number 55 should be number symbols.&#x20;

* [x] There are five new Secret Agents.&#x20;
* [x] Ten Secret Agents have started today's tasks.&#x20;
* [x] Secret Agents can earn 55 SCRT for today's tasks. &#x20;
* [x] There were 100 Secret Agents who completed today's tasks.&#x20;

For large round numbers, a combination of figures and words can be used with abbreviations.&#x20;

* [x] There are 1 billion privacy violations every day.&#x20;
* [x] There are 1bn privacy violations every day.&#x20;
* [x] The Secret Agent budget is $1 million.&#x20;
* [x] The Secret Agent budget is $1m.&#x20;

Words like first, second, and so on up to tenth should be spelled out. Any numbers above the tenth should use st/nd/rd/th.&#x20;

* [x] The first to fourth Secret Agents to complete the task today will earn 10 extra SCRT.&#x20;
* [x] The 11th to 23rd Secret Agents to complete the task today will earn 5 extra SCRT.&#x20;
