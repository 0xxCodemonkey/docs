# Node Set Up

This section will take you through the process of taking a node from fresh machine to full validator. The general steps are as follows:

1. [Install secretd](installation-and-setup.md)
2. [Install SGX](install-sgx.md)
3. [Setup the Full Node](full-node.md)
4. [Convert Full Node into Validator](becoming-a-validator.md)

If you wish to create an archive node, replace step 3 with [Running an Archive Node](../archive-nodes.md).
