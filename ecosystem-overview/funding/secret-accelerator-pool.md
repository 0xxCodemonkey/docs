# Secret Accelerator Pool

The Secret Accelerator Pool is funded with SCRT and run by Secret Labs. It is made for the Secret Network community to support builders making projects that support the growth initiatives, user targeting, and total value locked (TVL) of the Secret Network. The Accelerator Pool offers non-dilutive early-stage grant funding to teams working on network-level improvements, ecosystem tooling, and building applications. It is meant to be the starting place for new teams entering into the Secret Network before gaining access to the [Ecosystem Fund](ecosystem-fund.md).&#x20;
