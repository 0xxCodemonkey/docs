# BizDev & Growth

The BizDev & Growth Committee exists to be a liaison between the larger crypto ecosystem outside of SN and the internal organizations, committees, and products within SN. The main goal of the BizDev & Growth committee is to provide research and intelligence to the secret community, to leadership as well as committees on constantly evolving crypto world and where Secret Network fits in.&#x20;

The BizDev committee focuses on in person Business relations during events and is the first stop for any product creation or business questions from community members and potential partners. The BizDev committee helps SCRT labs with the approval of Grants and is the point of contact towards SCRT labs in many situations.&#x20;
