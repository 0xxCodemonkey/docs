# Secret Agents

## Secret Agents&#x20;

The most active members to committees are dubbed "Secret Agents". Agents can complete missions and open projects to earn ranking rewards or get paid in SCRT for producing content. [Everyone can become an Agent by following the steps laid out here](https://scrt.network/get-involved/become-secret-agent). The Secret Network committees host a weekly meeting to discuss their progress and keep the community up to date with their goals. Anyone can join at the given meeting time via discord to listen in and give feedback to the committees operations.
