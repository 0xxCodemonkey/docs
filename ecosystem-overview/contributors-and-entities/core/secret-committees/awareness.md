# Awareness

The Awareness committee focuses on creating engagement on Secret Network curated and in Secret network communities. The awareness committee is also the host of the Secret agent program and help new members onboard into the ecosystem and preach privacy across social media and other platforms. The Awareness team hosts the Agent platform and is also the contact point for University outreach and real life conferences.&#x20;

Any Secret Agent can suggest to go to their local crypto event and get supported with merch and a ticker. Please contact the Awareness team to organize speaking or stand opportunities at events. Brendan and SecretSkrillah are the Leaders of the Awareness committee and meet with the community every Monday 1500 UTC.&#x20;
