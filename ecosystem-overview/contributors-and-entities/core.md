#### Development

The Development Committee’s purpose is to foster a safe space for developers and teams to collaborate on the latest developments within Secret Network. The Committee will hold itself to the following core responsibilities:

1. Committee Meetings hosted every Monday at 5:00 PM UTC
2. Create Community Code Repositories with tightly scoped acceptance criteria (AC). Offer micro-bounties to any person or company who submits a PR that satisfies all AC. These projects are designed to be completed in 1 to 5 working days depending on the experience level of the contributor.
3. Appropriate funds to a Mentorship Program, whereas a recognized development member will be paid from the discretionary budget for pair programming time with new committee members who are looking for a faster onramp into the Network. The Development committee leads are Gino and Lumi who are available for contact via the #development channels in Discord or their emails gino@scrtnetwork.co and lumi@scrtnetwork.co

#### Support

The goal of this Support Team is to be a first line of defense for users on the Secret Network, and have been present and active during nearly every NFT mint/major event both in the Secret Community Discord and Telegram, and as well as the project’s respective channels. The support committee consists of 3 members (Waffle, ReverseSigh and MrGarbanzo) who you can recognize by their @support role in discord and Admin status in the official Telegram.

#### Governance

The Governance Committee exists to promote transparent collaboration within the network and provide neutral discussions on proposals, voting, and governance issues. We work closely together with validators and other committees to ensure optimal support for the overarching Secret Network goals. It is vital to provide a space where thoughts and ideas can freely and respectfully be exchanged by anyone within the Secret Network to aid in reaching informed consensus on-chain. The Governance committee lead is Pmuecke | SecretSauce which you can contact via the #Governance discord channel. The Governance committee hosts a meeting every Wednesday at 1500 UTC and hosts weekly meeting notes on the [forum](https://forum.scrt.network/t/governance-meeting-notes-mega-thread/3946/41).
