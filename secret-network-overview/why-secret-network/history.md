# History

**In February 2020**, over 20 independent validators launched a new blockchain that came to be known as Secret Network. This mainnet is a proof-of-stake blockchain based on Cosmos SDK / Tendermint and secured by a new native coin, Secret (SCRT). The collective vision for this blockchain was to create a privacy-first chain that would allow smart contracts to utilize private and sensitive data. The network would utilize privacy technologies that could enable secure computation over encrypted data.

**In September 2020**, a mainnet upgrade made Secret Network the only blockchain running live smart contracts with encrypted inputs, outputs, and state. That is possible because every node operator validating the network activity uses a secure enclave – the same type of technology securing your fingerprint on your smartphone. You can think of Secret Network as combining the programmability of Ethereum with the privacy of Zcash. This capability for "programmable privacy" now allows developers to begin building their own permissionless and privacy-preserving “Secret Apps.”

**Since this upgrade**, more and more use cases have been built and deployed, most notably the SNIP-20 standard for Secret Tokens. Several implementations of this standard were launched, including secretSCRT (a privacy-preserving variant of SCRT), community tokens (such as FAT SCRT, sALT, and many others), and thanks to the Secret Ethereum Bridge, a wide-variety of Ethereum assets (including ETH and many other prominent ERC-20 tokens). Other use-cases showcasing the power of Secret Contracts (such as Secret Auctions and Secret Vaults) have been deployed to the network, and many other use-cases are currently being built.

**In December 2020**, the Secret Ethereum Bridge brought the power of programmable privacy to ETH and ERC-20s at low cost.

**In February 2021,** SecretSwap launched on the Secret Network mainnet - the first AMM (Automated Market Maker) to be launched in our ecosystem and a one-of-a-kind product for the blockchain space. This is a critical piece of Secret DeFi, unlocking new liquidity for secret tokens!
