# Privacy for Blockchain

## Crypto's Privacy Problem

When the average person thinks of cryptocurrency, they think of anonymity, privacy, and anonymity. Unfortunately the reality of blockchain couldn't be farther from these three aspects. Blockchains are public ledgers with no semblance of data privacy in which every transaction and interaction you've made or will make is public information. Everything you do is not only being watched by government actors (to which the familiar adage is stated "if I have nothing to hide I have nothing to fear"), but also to criminals who can and will use your data when targeting you.

As a thought exercise, try thinking of transactions you've made (or haven't made) that might be valuable to someone targeting you. The first things that may come to mind are whether you've purchased an alarm system for your house or dog food for your personal fluffy home defense system. You may even notice that plane tickets were purchased, signalling your house is ripe for an unopposed break-in.

All of this info and more becomes available to the entire world on traditional blockchain infrastructure, creating a very real threat to everyone that uses it.



## Secret Network's Solution

Secret Network is the only main-net blockchain providing private encrypted smart contracts. That means that everything that happens inside, and all data stored is yours alone until you make the choice to reveal it, and the choice of who specifically you reveal it to. You, the user, are given total control over your own data, an immensely powerful and important capability in today's world.

Want to hide private images in NFTs? Easy. Want to send private messages to your friends and family over the blockchain? There's a dapp for that. With privacy added to the equation anything is possible on blockchain, and Secret Network is your doorway to those countless possibilities.
