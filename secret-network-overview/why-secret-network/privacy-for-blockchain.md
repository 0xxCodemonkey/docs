The problem with privacy for crypto

Cryptocurrency in its original vision was always meant to provide a private way of p2p interaction but lately this vision has only gone further and further from the truth. Although blockchain still has a pseudonymous structure it has become harder and harder for users to keep their real life identity locked away from their cryptocurrency wallet. Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations for Centralized Exchanges (CEX), Profile picture NFTs, Chainanalysis by large players and data harvesting on public APIs, wallet providers and Cryptocurrency social accounts all form risks for the privacy of single users. Personal finances have never been part of the public information but with growing blockchain adoption this has become somewhat of a reality for a lot of people.&#x20;
