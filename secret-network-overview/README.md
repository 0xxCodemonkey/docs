# Secret Network Overview

**Programmable privacy for a Proof Of Stake Blockchain**\
Secret Network is a distributed ledger technology, also called a blockchain, with permisionless private smart contracts. The Secret Network Blockchain makes use of the Cosmos Tendermint consensus module and the Tendermint SDK. The Byzance Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus on the network is ran by 80 validator nodes, who all run a specific type of CPU called a TEE (Trusted execution environment). The Secret network is designed to send encrypted inputs for computation to the TEE. This chip inside the full node acts as a blackbox meaning no one, not even the validator can see what happens inside. Data is decrypted inside the TEE, computations are completed and then the result is encrypted and returned to the blockchain state. All validators process all transactions and reach consensus after 2/3d of the voting power agrees. This powerful technology combined with Key Management and hash encryption protocols allow Secret Network to have Computational Privacy. Secret contracts are a specific purpose build of CosmWasm contracts that allow for private metadata.\


**Secret (SCRT) architecture**\
Secret Network uses a Delegated proof-of-stake (Dpos) consensus method, the native coin is SCRT (Pronounced "Secret"). SCRT is used to pay gas on the network and can be staked to participate in governance and earn a yield. SCRT is a public token but has a private representative (just like all tokens on Secret Network) called sSCRT. This SNIP-20 token has private metadata and can therefore be used in Transactional and Computational Privacy tasks on the network. Other tokens of Dapps like SHD, SEFI, SIENNA, ALTER, JKL etc are also SNIP-20 tokens with privacy characteristics.

**Community**\
Secret Network is being developed by both individual developers, Dapp teams and the core development group called SCRT Labs. You can contribute by forking the [github](https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork) or by joining the [Discord](https://chat.scrt.network) and finding a development team.
