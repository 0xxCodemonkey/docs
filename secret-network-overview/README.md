# Secret Network Overview

Secret Network is the first blockchain with customizable privacy. You get to choose what you share, with whom, and how. This protects users, and empowers developers to build a better Web3. Built with the robust Tendermint SDK Secret Network provides scalable private permisionless smart contracts to the interchain. Privacy by default is essential to the security and adoption of the decentralized web. User side privacy not only enables novel use cases but also puts users back in charge of their own sensitive data.

**Privacy technology**

Secret Network leverages novel key management techniques, encryption schemes and Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology to bring encrypted input, output and state to blockchain. The decentralized network of computers that host Secret Network come to consensus (delegated Proof-Of-Stake — Byzance Fault Tolerance) without ever obtaining access to the data they process. Users can use “viewing keys” to view their sensitive data or enable third parties to do the same.

**Smart contract use-cases**

“Secret contracts” , an implementation of the Rust based library CosmWasm, enable computation with private metadata. This brings unique use cases to Secret Network which simply aren’t possible on other blockchains. Miner Extractable Value (MEV) does not exist on Secret Network due to the encrypted mempool and state of the chain, protecting users from getting front run on their transactions. Dapps on Secret Network can leverage private metadata to provide a multitude of products like: user side encrypted data storage and communication, NFTs with private content and ownership, Lending protocols with private collateralization information, fully on-chain card games with hidden state and any application requiring true on-chain randomness.

**The SCRT coin and Secret tokens**

Secret Network as a public layer 1 blockchain has a native coin dubbed “SCRT” (pronounced SCRT) which is used for gas fees, governance and Proof-Of-Stake (POS) Security. By wrapping SCRT or any bridged token (Ethereum, Binance SC, Monero, Cosmos/IBC) into their “Secret token” (SNIP-20) counterpart users gain immediate privacy. The balance and every interaction with “Secret tokens” is private by default. Secret tokens can be used to buy/sell NFTs, participate in DeFi, pay in private, escrow for data/content and even to get a credit scoring all while maintaining your financial privacy.

**Ecosystem**

Secret Network and its applications are build out by a community of over 100 dedicated developers and business leads from all over the world. The network and its builders are supported by the community pool, SCRT labs, the Secret foundation, 80 validators and a multitude of infrastructure and investment partners. The Secret Network community dubbed “Secret Agents” are eager to test and enjoy new applications while spreading the importance of web3 privacy online and at real life events.

**History and roadmap**

Secret Network has come a long way, with the core development group starting out in 2017 and the mainnet launching in early 2020. The most recent string of updates dubbed “Supernova” and “Shockwave” have brought Secret Network IBC interoperability, 200x performance upgrades for encrypted verification's, the launch of permits for user authentication, multiple performance optimizations for blockchain Queries, a more redundant API node infrastructure and IBC compatible cross-chain smart contract integration. On the core development roadmap is the replacement of the smart contract engine for a more performant version, bringing a massive overall transaction throughput upgrade in Q3 2022.

**Transactional vs computational privacy**

Secret Network differs greatly from protocols like Monero, zcash etc because it does not aim to provide complete transactional privacy but focuses on programmable privacy, a different use-case entirely. Unlike other privacy protocols Secret Network does not utilize “group-oriented anonymous signature schemes” but assures privacy through encryption and specified hardware. Secret Network does not utilize ZK-proofs (ZKPs), Multi Party Computation (MPC) or HomoMorphic Encryption (HME) to achieve private for scalability, technical infeasabillity and information centralization concerns. The core development group and founder Guy Zyskind strive to deploy the best software based cryptographic solution possible much like the original [paper from MIT](http://homepage.cs.uiowa.edu/\~ghosh/blockchain.pdf) when the technology is ready for that.

#### Conclusion

Blockchains that have all data of every smart contract and transaction publicly visible are limited in their capacity to generate effective use cases where privacy is a fundamental component of the feasibility of the application. There has never been a greater need for easily accessible privacy solutions inside and outside the blockchain space. The intent of the Secret Network is to be an open-source protocol that enables a wide range of privacy-preserving tools and applications through programmable privacy — improving the adoption and usability of decentralized technologies.
