# IBC

## Introduction

The Inter Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol is a set of rules for intercommunication between blockchains. Blockchains that can communicate are aware of each otherâ€™s existence and can exchange information with one another. This means IBC applications can send and receive data from multiple chains, and developers can build multi-blockchain applications.&#x20;

While Cosmos is the first implementation of IBC, the protocol itself is designed as a modular standard so it remains compatible across chains as blockchain technology evolves.

### Who Developed IBC?&#x20;

At the highest level, IBC is an initiative developed by Tendermint, the organization behind Cosmos Hub, aiming to power interoperability between blockchains. As such, it enables different blockchains to send and receive transactions between one another.

## A Cross-Chain Protocol For Secret Network

IBC is a cross-chain protocol: it needs to be built into each blockchain in order for it to take part in a cross-chain transaction. Secret Network is adding support for smart contracts over IBC, so that with the upcoming Shockwave Omega update, any blockchain will be able to work with secure private data by calling a function on a smart contract on Secret!
