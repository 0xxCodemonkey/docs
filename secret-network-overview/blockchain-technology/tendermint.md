# Tendermint

## Introduction

Tendermint is a consensus algorithm capable of high scalability, low latency, and a fault-tolerant approach to building blockchain networks. It is the underlying technology powering the Cosmos Network and its hub of interconnected blockchains, including Secret Network.&#x20;

## Tendermint Vs. Proof-of-Work Vs. Proof-of-Stake

Tendermint offers an alternative to traditional Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithms with a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) approach that allows for instant finality. This means block confirmations are finalized within seconds as opposed to minutes or even hours like other consensus mechanisms.&#x20;

## Advantages&#x20;

With faster speeds comes more transactions per second (TPS), which improves the overall user experience by reducing wait times in network congestion periods. However, these improved speeds come at the risk of greater centralization if there are not enough validators participating in a network.

## Challenges

One of the biggest challenges facing blockchains is scalability. In order to solve this problem, Tendermint has built a framework that allows you to build blockchains using any consensus algorithm you want.

## How It Works

Tendermint is a consensus engine that can be used to build a blockchain. Itâ€™s a PBFT consensus engine that uses Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) protocols and allows for high throughput, low latency transactions.&#x20;

Tendermint consensus is based on the PBFT algorithm, which stands for "Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance". This kind of BFT algorithm is asynchronous, meaning it does not rely on every node reaching a consensus at the same time. Instead, each node keeps track of its current view of the blockchain and updates this view whenever it receives new information from other nodes.
